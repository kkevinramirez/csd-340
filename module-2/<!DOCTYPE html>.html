        <h2>Chapter Title: Getting to Know Me</h2>
        <p class="intro">I grew up in Acambaro, where I enjoyed playing soccer. My family includes grandparents, parents, and cousins.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite hobbies is playing chess, which I have been doing for several years. <span class="sentence">It's a great way to relax and spend my time.</span></p>
        <p>Another interest of mine is playing video games, which I picked up during my teenage years. It keeps me motivated and inspired.</p>
        <p>Outside of my hobbies, I work on projects like this one for Bellevue University and enjoy learning about technology.</p>
